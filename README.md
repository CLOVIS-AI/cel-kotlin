# Common Expression Language

Kotlin Multiplatform implementation of [CEL, the Common Expression Language](https://cel.dev).

> Common Expression Language (CEL) is an expression language that’s fast, portable, and safe to execute in performance-critical applications. CEL is designed to be embedded in an application, with application-specific extensions, and is ideal for extending declarative configurations that your applications might already use.
>
> Use CEL for things like list filters for API calls, validation constraints on protocol buffers, and authorization rules for API requests.
